**Notes for BENJAMIN TAULBUT: ** 
According to Janet Taulbut... The Taulbut's c1700-1800 were Agricultural Labourers in the Upham Area of Hampshire  
  
Added 10/1/2000: Researching Talbot's throughout Hampshire... The parish's of Broughton,
Crux Easton and St Mary Bourne appear to show a number of Talbot's... Thats where we need
to look next in the hunt for Benjamin's parents... best to start with the marriages and
then baptisms as they may well show either the spelling of Taulbut, if they could write,
or Benjamin's baptism record probably with the surname spelt Talbot. I also need to check
out the Richard Talbot(sometimes spelt) Talbut of Titchfield. There is a will for a Richard
Talbot and Derek has sent details of a Richard Talbot who help built the dyke that cut
titchfield off from the sea, destroying it as a port.  
  
Added 14/1/2000: The IGI for Sussex shows that a George Talbot and Mary (nee Chatsfield),
baptised a Benjamin Talbot on 09 April 1754 in the town of Arundel, West Sussex. George
married Mary on 02 July 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex. A Thomas Tolbot was christened 
by George Talbot on 25 February 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex.  
  
Added 24/4/2000: Janet Taulbut writes 27th March 2000...went to Winchester records
office and decided to go through as many records as possible looking for a baptism
of any type of Talbot/Taulbut I tried South Stonham/North Stonham/Owlesbury/Bishopstoke/Bishops
Waltham/Corhampton Durley. I found a George Talbut son of Thomas at South Stonham 1773 then 
a Sarah of Thomas Talbot buried June 22nd 1775. There was a James Talbot to a Thomas and Olive
on October 29th 1775 at Droxford... Mile Talbot told me October 6th 1996 that a Miss Barnes
79, Peel Street South Canterbury New Zealand had written to say that a Sarah Taulbot born 
Upham on February 28th 1779 (I have not seen this) married a William Wilkinson at Alverstoke
on October 3rd 1809. They say he had a distant connection to the Earl of Mar. Her letter
was sent 1987.
