Notes for BENJAMIN TAULBUT:

According to Janet Taulbut... The Taulbut's c1700-1800 were Agricultural Labourers in the Upham Area of Hampshire

Added 10/1/2000: Researching Talbot's throughout Hampshire... The parish's of Broughton, Crux Easton and St Mary Bourne appear to show a number of Talbot's... Thats where we need to look next in the hunt for Benjamin's parents... best to start with the marriages and then baptisms as they may well show either the spelling of Taulbut, if they could write, or Benjamin's baptism record probably with the surname spelt Talbot. I also need to check out the Richard Talbot(sometimes spelt) Talbut of Titchfield. There is a will for a Richard Talbot and Derek has sent details of a Richard Talbot who help built the dyke that cut titchfield off from the sea, destroying it as a port.

Added 14/1/2000: The IGI for Sussex shows that a George Talbot and Mary (nee Chatsfield), baptised a Benjamin Talbot on 09 April 1754 in the town of Arundel, West Sussex. George married Mary on 02 July 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex. A Thomas Tolbot was christened by George Talbot on 25 February 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex.

Added 24/4/2000: Janet Taulbut writes 27th March 2000...went to Winchester {records office] and decided to go through as many records as possible looking for a baptism of any type of Talbot/Taulbut I tried South Stonham/North Stonham/Owlesbury/Bishopstoke/Bishops Waltham/Corhampton Durley. I found a George Talbut son of Thomas at South Stonham 1773 then a Sarah of Thomas Talbot buried June 22nd 1775. There was a James Talbot to a Thomas and Olive on October 29th 1775 at Droxford... Mile Talbot told me October 6th 1996 that a Miss Barnes 79, Peel Street South Canterbury New Zealand had written to say that a Sarah Taulbot born Upham on February 28th 1779 (I have not seen this) married a William Wilkinson at Alverstoke on October 3rd 1809. They say he had a distant connection to the Earl of Mar. Her letter was sent 1987.

Added 30/6/2000: Early Taulbut's Research

Researching Benjamin Talbot as his surname was written in the majority of public records on the man. I found a Benjamin Talbot christening record in the Sussex IGI, for the 9 April 1754 in Arundel,West Sussex. His parents were a George/Mary Talbot.

I found a marriage record in the same Sussex IGI for a George Talbot and Mary Chatfield on 2 July 1749 in Arundel.

I found a christening record for a Thomas Tolbot on 25 February 1749 in Arundel. No record of a mother is found just a father George Tolbot. Why is their no mother mentioned? I found a christening record for a George Talbott on 25 September 1715 in Wiston. Parents were John Talbott and Ann. No further records are mentioned in the Sussex IGI for George and Mary, which strikes me as rather strange as most families had more than two children. There could be a number of reasons for the lack of further records. One of them could be that the family moved and finally ended up in Hampshire, perhaps near Upham. Scanning through the Hampshire IGI I came across a christening record for a Mary Talbott on 11 December 1757, Bishops Waltham, Parents George Talbott and Mary. Bishops Waltham is to the south of Upham.

So was there Talbots living in Bishops Waltham before 1757?' So George and Mary may have moved to Bishops Waltham.

Yes, only Mary Talbot who married Edward Birch 19 Jun 1673 Bishops Waltham. More About BENJAMIN TAULBUT:

Burial: 21 August 1835, St Peter & St Paul Church, Fareham, Hampshire, England (Benjamin Talbot No.

1687), Aged 80

Residence 1: 1785, Upham, Hampshire

Notes for LEAH BOYCE:

Janet Taulbut writes ...whilst I was searching for the Upham record I found what looked like Mariah Complin daughter of Leah Boyce baptised February 14 1779. So she obviously had a 5 1/2 year old daughter when she married Ben. That is if the child lived. I could not find the name Complin anywhere if that is menat to be a surname.

There were Chandlers in the village. The second Ben married [Ann] Chandler at Petersfield but perhaps her relatives lived in Upham.

Also found Leah's baptism record. Her parents Michael and May Boyce More About LEAH BOYCE:

Notes for LEAH TAULBUT:

Could this be the Ann Taulbut, who married Thomas Howard in 1904 in the Parish of Alverstoke? If not how is Ann Taulbut related to Benjamin and Leah. I can not find any record of Ann's birth in Fareham. What happened to Leah Taulbut?
