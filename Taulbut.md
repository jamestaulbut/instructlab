1.  BENJAMIN1 TAULBUT was born Abt. 1755 in may be Hampshire, Parish Unknown, and died 1835 in Fareham, Hampshire,England.

Notes for BENJAMIN TAULBUT:

According to Janet Taulbut... The Taulbut's c1700-1800 were Agricultural Labourers in the Upham Area of Hampshire

Added 10/1/2000: Researching Talbot's throughout Hampshire... The parish's of Broughton, Crux Easton and St Mary Bourne appear to show a number of Talbot's... Thats where we need to look next in the hunt for Benjamin's parents... best to start with the marriages and then baptisms as they may well show either the spelling of Taulbut, if they could write, or Benjamin's baptism record probably with the surname spelt Talbot. I also need to check out the Richard Talbot(sometimes spelt) Talbut of Titchfield. There is a will for a Richard Talbot and Derek has sent details of a Richard Talbot who help built the dyke that cut titchfield off from the sea, destroying it as a port.

Added 14/1/2000: The IGI for Sussex shows that a George Talbot and Mary (nee Chatsfield), baptised a Benjamin Talbot on 09 April 1754 in the town of Arundel, West Sussex. George married Mary on 02 July 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex. A Thomas Tolbot was christened by George Talbot on 25 February 1749 in Arundel, West Sussex.

Added 24/4/2000: Janet Taulbut writes 27th March 2000...went to Winchester {records office] and decided to go through as many records as possible looking for a baptism of any type of Talbot/Taulbut I tried South Stonham/North Stonham/Owlesbury/Bishopstoke/Bishops Waltham/Corhampton Durley. I found a George Talbut son of Thomas at South Stonham 1773 then a Sarah of Thomas Talbot buried June 22nd 1775. There was a James Talbot to a Thomas and Olive on October 29th 1775 at Droxford... Mile Talbot told me October 6th 1996 that a Miss Barnes 79, Peel Street South Canterbury New Zealand had written to say that a Sarah Taulbot born Upham on February 28th 1779 (I have not seen this) married a William Wilkinson at Alverstoke on October 3rd 1809. They say he had a distant connection to the Earl of Mar. Her letter was sent 1987.

Added 30/6/2000: Early Taulbut's Research

Researching Benjamin Talbot as his surname was written in the majority of public records on the man. I found a Benjamin Talbot christening record in the Sussex IGI, for the 9 April 1754 in Arundel,West Sussex. His parents were a George/Mary Talbot.

I found a marriage record in the same Sussex IGI for a George Talbot and Mary Chatfield on 2 July 1749 in Arundel.

I found a christening record for a Thomas Tolbot on 25 February 1749 in Arundel. No record of a mother is found just a father George Tolbot. Why is their no mother mentioned? I found a christening record for a George Talbott on 25 September 1715 in Wiston. Parents were John Talbott and Ann. No further records are mentioned in the Sussex IGI for George and Mary, which strikes me as rather strange as most families had more than two children. There could be a number of reasons for the lack of further records. One of them could be that the family moved and finally ended up in Hampshire, perhaps near Upham. Scanning through the Hampshire IGI I came across a christening record for a Mary Talbott on 11 December 1757, Bishops Waltham, Parents George Talbott and Mary. Bishops Waltham is to the south of Upham.

So was there Talbots living in Bishops Waltham before 1757?' So George and Mary may have moved to Bishops Waltham.

Yes, only Mary Talbot who married Edward Birch 19 Jun 1673 Bishops Waltham. More About BENJAMIN TAULBUT:

Residence 1: 1785, Upham, Hampshire

Notes for LEAH BOYCE:

Janet Taulbut writes ...whilst I was searching for the Upham record I found what looked like Mariah Complin daughter of Leah Boyce baptised February 14 1779. So she obviously had a 5 1/2 year old daughter when she married Ben. That is if the child lived. I could not find the name Complin anywhere if that is menat to be a surname.

There were Chandlers in the village. The second Ben married [Ann] Chandler at Petersfield but perhaps her relatives lived in Upham.

Also found Leah's baptism record. Her parents Michael and May Boyce More About LEAH BOYCE:

Notes for ELIZABETH MARTHA BROWNE:

email from a Peter Porter

The Sir Anthony Browne, ca. 1500-1568, the Master of the Horse for King Henry the VII, was the second of that name. His father, Sir Anthony Browne, ca. 1443-1505, was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Browne who is considered the founder of this line. In 1431 Sir Thomas, married Eleanor Fitz-Alan de Arundel, a Plantagenet heiress. Due to the political intrigues surrounding the War of the Roses Sir Thomas Browne was beheaded June 20, 1460.

This family was prominent in England during the War of the Roses and throughout Tudor times. Ca.

1400-1600. They are referred to as the Brownes of Bechworth Castle, a small barony south of London near modern Guildford and Dorking. This fiefdom came to Sir Thomas Browne as part of the dowry of Eleanor when they

married ca. 1431.

This Sir Thomas and his ancestors and descendants are in the LDS Ancestral File database. Sir Thomas' can be found in AFN 9G62-8J. The LDS Library which can be obtained on microfilm has a copy of chapter VII of John Pym Yeatman's 1903 book: "Feudal History of the County of Derbyshire." This chapter deals with this Browne family in detail.

My descent from this family is through Sir Thomas' first son, Sir George Browne. (In 1483, Sir George Browne, like his father, was beheaded due to his political activities.) This would be the first Sir Anthony's brother.

I'm curious how your Anthony Browne of the nineteenth century is related to this family. There were two more Sir Anthony Brownes in direct line. The last of whom was Sheriff of Surrey and Kent and died the same year as his father, 1592. Many of the younger sons of these genteel families migrated into the early North American Colonies.

There is an Sir Anthony Browne who is listed as a shareholder in the early Jamestown, Virginia papers and who, according to Company records, evinced an intent to travel there in the second decade of the 1600s.

Some sources trace this line of Anthonys into early New England through a Colonel Willam Browne. I hope this helps.

Marriage Notes for ANTHONY TAULBUT and ROSINA HEIGHTON:

James Taulbut received an email from Barry Tietjen on 6th May 2002 who wrote :-

" I recently became aware of the Mission website and noted especially the information on Anthony Taulbut. My grandparents, Mr. & Mrs Tom Fussell of Steelhead, were friends of Mr. Taulbut and his wife Rosina. I have just gone through one of our family photo albums and have located a few pictures of Mr. Taulbut and his wife. I also have an informal note written to my mother shortly after her marriage to Mr. Bill Tietjen, and a letter from Mr. Taulbut acknowledging my mother's resignation from service as a teacher in the Mission district. I also have a picture which is inscribed "Peggy" (my mother) and Vera in the Taulbut garden". I'm not sure who Vera is, but I could

probably find her likeness in some of the other photos. I am enclosing the copy of the Golden Wedding Anniversary Photo dated Mar. 13, 1949. Their is a handwritten inscription on the back of the photo:

'To Peggy and Bill & family, from "Uncle Tony & Aunty Rose Golden Wedding Anniversary of Anthony & Rosina Taulbut, March 13/49'

I can only vaguely remember Sunday visits by the Taulbuts to my grandparents home in Steelhead, but I do remember the name coming up in many conversations. My grandfather served on the school board with Mr. Taulbut for a number of years. I believe I have a photo of the Board as well".
