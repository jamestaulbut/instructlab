This is the **first generation** of the **TAULBUT family history**, from **Hampshire, England**. 

The **first Taulbut** who spelled his last name as **TAULBUT** is **BENJAMIN1 TAULBUT**, **a male born about 1755** (exact place of birth unknown). **He married LEAH BOYCE on 8th November 1785** in **Upham, Hampshire, England**.

Her baptism record is dated 22nd June 1760 in Upham, Hampshire, and is recorded in the Baptism Latter Day Saints record for Fareham, Hampshire, England (IGI Number 7126508, sheet 99). Leah Boyce was buried on 3rd July 1840 in Saint Peter & Paul Church, Fareham, Hampshire, England. The burial record (Number 2182) is under the name of LEAH TALBOTT, and I correlated this using her age at death (82) with her birth year.
